# Maryland Vehicle Crashes

### Objective
The objective of the Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crashes dataset can be to better understand the factors that contribute to vehicle crashes in the state of Maryland and to develop strategies to improve road safety. The data provides information on the date, time, location, and type of crashes, as well as the number of vehicles involved and casualties.

The dataset can be used to answer questions such as:

    1) What are the most common causes of vehicle crashes in Maryland?
    2) Where are the highest risk areas for vehicle crashes in the state?
    3) What time of day and what days of the week are most likely to see a crash occur?
    4) How do different types of crashes (e.g., rear-end, head-on, sideswipe) vary in frequency and severity?
    5) How does weather and road conditions impact the frequency and severity of crashes?

### About the Dataset:
- Crash data for Maryland from January 2015 through September 2022.
- Only Approved Crash reports have been included in the file.
- The data includes information on the date and time of the crash, the location, the type of crash, the number of vehicles involved, and the number of casualties. 
- It consists of 849k rows and 55 columns.

### Dataset Source
The Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crashes dataset is a collection of data on vehicle crashes that occurred in Maryland.
